## üìÅ Project Header Files

This directory is intended for project header files.
This project focuses on the smart measurement of batteries, identifying faulty batteries, and performing periodic checks on the battery state. The goal is to provide accurate and reliable battery diagnostics to ensure optimal performance and longevity of batteries used in various applications.

By implementing advanced algorithms and state-of-the-art technology, the system can monitor battery health in real-time, detect anomalies, and predict potential failures before they occur. This proactive approach helps in maintaining the efficiency and safety of battery-operated devices, reducing downtime, and extending the overall lifespan of the batteries.

Key features of the project include:

- **Smart Measurement**: Utilizing precise sensors and data analysis techniques to measure various parameters of the battery, such as voltage, current, temperature, and internal resistance.
- **Fault Detection**: Identifying and diagnosing issues with batteries, such as capacity loss, internal short circuits, and other faults that could affect performance.
- **Periodic Checks**: Conducting regular assessments of battery health to ensure they are operating within optimal parameters and to schedule maintenance or replacements as needed.

This project is designed to be adaptable for use in a wide range of applications, from consumer electronics to industrial equipment, ensuring that batteries remain reliable and efficient throughout their lifecycle.
